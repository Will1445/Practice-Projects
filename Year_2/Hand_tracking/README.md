## Venv guide for mediapipe 

This file requires mediapipe to establish the landmark points on each hand. This package is not currently updated to python 3.13 so to run this file, you must create a virtual environment running python 3.11 or 3.12 (3.11 recommended for stability). 

The recommended method for doing this is to install python3.11 using pyenv to efficiently manage your different python versions.

Reminder to remove this 3.11.11 environment along with python3.11.11 and pyenv (if no longer needed) when either:

- mediapipe is updated to 3.13 (or current version)
- Alternative to mediapipe is found that keeps functionality
